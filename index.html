        <h2>Type-Bit</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This game was developed as a team project at the end of the first class of the school I attended.
          It is a Typing Game, the player has to type the words which appear on screen as fast as possible.
          There are 8 levels of increasing difficulty.
          The code is simple but it was very fun to develop and we were really happy with the final result.
          You can play it by pressing the button at the bottom of the box, try it, it's fun!</p>
